This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

##About The App 
Its a Widget application that will include multiple components. These components will be:

An Accordion component

A Wikipedia API search component

A Dropdown item selection component

A Google Translate API component

We have wrapped up the Widgets application by building our own navigation using JS and React without a third-party library like React Router. This is be used to navigate between the different widget components that were built.

### `npm start`
